## My process
1.) Mockup
2.) Mobile Design
3.) Tablet Design
4.) Desktop Design

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
I continued building on the foundations of responsive web design. I also learned how to utilize flex-direction to manipulate elements in a container more fluidly.

### Continued development
I want to learn more about placing overlays over images. I couldn't quite crack the code on this one. Looking into future development to see how to do this.
